This script can touch down a [results_dir] into a xlsx file.
1. Before running, you should ensure that you have installed the xlsxwriter package.
   A recommended way to get xlsxwriter is running:
   sudo pip install xlsxwriter
2. run:
   python getPerfExcel.py [results_dir]
   !  It supports the relative path. So there's no need to copy the script.
3. The excel file is located at the current directory named "perfs.xlsx"
 
Note:
The results_dir should like this
results-all/
├── results-dm
│   ├── 40G_GREP_DM
│   ├── 40G_KM5_DM
│   ├── 40G_SORT_DM
│   ├── 40G_TERA_DM
│   ├── 40G_WC_DM
│   ├── 80G_GREP_DM
│   ├── 80G_KM5_DM
│   ├── 80G_SORT_DM
│   ├── 80G_TERA_DM
│   └── 80G_WC_DM
└── results-had
    ├── 40G_GREP_HAD
    ├── 40G_KM5_HAD
    ├── 40G_SORT_HAD
    ├── 40G_TERA_HAD
    ├── 40G_WC_HAD
    ├── 80G_GREP_HAD
    ├── 80G_KM5_HAD
    ├── 80G_SORT_HAD
    ├── 80G_TERA_HAD
    └── 80G_WC_HAD
And each job dir should have a perf.log file.
